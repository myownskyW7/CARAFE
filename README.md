## Setup CARAFE Operator

There are two ways to setup CARAFE operator.


A. Install mmcv which contains CARAFE.

CARAFE is supported in mmcv.
You may install mmcv following the official guideline.
```
https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv
```



B. Install CARAFE directly from GitHub.

Requirements:

```
CUDA >= 9.0, Pytorch >= 1.3, Python >= 3.6
```

Install with `pip`
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/zgzhengSEU/CARAFE.git@master
```

Run gradient check to make sure the operator is successfully compiled
```
$ python

>>> from carafe import grad_check
```

C. Compile CARAFE from source.

Requirements:

```
CUDA >= 9.0, Pytorch >= 1.3, Python >= 3.6
```

Git clone this repo.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zgzhengSEU/CARAFE.git
```

Setup CARAFE op.
```shell
cd CARAFE
python setup.py develop
# or "pip install -v -e ."
```

Run gradient check to make sure the operator is successfully compiled
```
$ python

>>> from carafe import grad_check
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from mmcv.ops.carafe import CARAFEPack
# or "from carafe import CARAFEPack"


x = torch.rand(2, 40, 50, 70)
model = CARAFEPack(channels=40, scale_factor=2)

model = model.cuda()
x = x.cuda()

out = model(x)

print('original shape: ', x.shape)
print('upscaled shape: ', out.shape)
```
